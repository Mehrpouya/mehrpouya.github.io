#Edinburgh University OXFAM, an exhibition on inequality

A photograph that I have taken around 5 years ago has been chosen to feature in Edinburgh University OXFAM inequality exhibition. The exhibition was on Friday 20th of March 2015.

And this the story of it:

> There are many children living in the streets of Mashhad and they are
being managed by a father who is in charge of a minimum of 6 children.
They are being forced to work and sell products in the streets in order
to get shelter and food. Some people never buy any products from them to
not to support child labour, and as a consequence they may be punished
physically, verbally or miss a meal.
>
This is not a new issue and still exists in majority of big cities in
Iran, This picture was taken 5 years ago when I was on my way to my
University.
