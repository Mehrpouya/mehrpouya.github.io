summary: How can we reduce the amount of energy that schools use in things like lighting and electrical equipment? This 4 days workshop/exhibitio aims to engage with participants( age 5-90) about our perceptions of energy. Drop in to try some devices designed to solve this problem by allowing people, objects, sensors, data and machines to interact, creating opportunities to use energy more wisely.

#Learning Energy Systems in the Museum

In February 2015, I joined a very interesting research project led by Dr [Kate Carter][kate] senior lecturer in Architecture department at [Edinburgh College of Art][eca].

[Learning Energy Systems][les] aims is to develop design interventions and objects to study the link between learning and energy consumption. This project is in collaboration with Edinburgh Council and currently working with school communities in Scotland. Our aim is to develop interactions between pupils and the energy system in their schools.
