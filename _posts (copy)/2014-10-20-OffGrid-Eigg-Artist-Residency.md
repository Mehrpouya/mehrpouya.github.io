#Eigg Artist Residency

In Summer 2014 Eco Travel Network(ETN) - a limited company based in Wales â€“ founded by Alison Kidd and Peter Williams, started a [2 month trial](http://www.ecotravelnetwork.co.uk/ETN-News/eco-travel-network-starts-trial-on-isle-of-eigg) of the [Renault Twizy](http://www.renault.co.uk/cars/electric-vehicles/twizy/twizy) on Isle of Eigg as an alternative low carbon road transport.

The vehicle has been equipped with a GPS device in order to record its movements and use on Eigg. In addition to this ETN also used diary research method to collect some qualitative measures from each family using the car for a period of one week.

I made a rough visualisation of about one month of collected data using Cartodb platform. Thanks to [Off Grid project](http://lifeoffthegrid.net/) and in Particular [Alice Street](http://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/staff/social_anthropology/alice_street) and [Jamie Cross](http://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/staff/social_anthropology/cross_jamie) from Anthropology department, University of Edinburgh for the opportunity and providing me with access to their Cartodb subscription.

The primary aim of ETN in this trial is to find ways to make individuals linking between personal travel and energy. this research requires mix of methods and approaches to develop a way to entangle some of the complexities around linking community, mobility and energy. I will be using mix of ethnography methods during this 10 days, interviews, mobile methods: giving a lift to people on Eigg and using gopro and microphone to record some of the conversations and the experice of driving the car and journey, photography and at the end a feedback session in collaboration with Eco Travel Network including all fifteen families who used Twizy.
